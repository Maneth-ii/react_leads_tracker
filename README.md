# react_leads_tracker

this is simple React-based web app that allows users to add and delete items from a list. Users can input URLs or any other text, which will be added to the list dynamically. Each item in the list is displayed as a clickable link, and users can delete individual items by clicking on the "X" button next to each item. It provides a straightforward user interface for managing and interacting with a dynamic list of items.
